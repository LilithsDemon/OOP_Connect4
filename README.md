This program is written in C# and is a object orientated approach to the well known connect 4 game.

### Running the program

- To be able to run the program you can first go into the embedded Connect4 folder
- In here you can use dotnet run to be able to run the program

#### Paramaters

While using dotnet run there are 2 options

1. Running with no paramaters which plays the full game - ```dotnet run```
    - Each user enter's their name and chooses their counter colour
2. Using the parameter fast - ```dotnet run fast```
    - Run's the game without users choosing their name or counter colour
    - Is supposed to just start the game in a faster method with less user input
